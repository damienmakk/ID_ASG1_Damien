YE WORLD

YE WORLD is a fan-made website dedicated to Kanye West’s live shows and music.
It acts as a central hub where fans can:

-Discover upcoming tour dates
-Check out featured music and videos
-Follow Kanye on social platforms
-Sign up for email updates

The goal is to recreate the vibe of an official artist site, while keeping the layout clean and easy to use. Think of it as a one-stop place for fans to see what’s happening next and how to be part of it.

This site is also built as a school project, so it demonstrates my ability to design a full webpage from wireframe to final coded prototype, using consistent branding, layout and interaction patterns.

**Design Process**

**Target Audience**
-Kanye West fans who want to know when and where he’s performing
-New listeners who want a quick way to explore his music & videos
-Visitors who want to stay updated via email and socials

The design focuses on:
-A strong hero section with a large Kanye GIF to immediately set the mood
-A clear, structured Tour / Shows experience so users can quickly scan dates
-Simple, bold calls-to-action (Tickets, View All Dates, Sign Up)
-Easy access to social links to continue the experience off-site

**User Stories**

Some example user stories that guided the design:
-As a fan, I want to see upcoming tour dates, so that I can decide which show I can attend.
-As a fan, I want to view all the shows on a dedicated page, so that I can scroll through everything in one place.
-As a fan, I want to click a Tickets button, so that I can go to the next step of buying tickets.
-As a new visitor, I want to quickly understand what this website is about, so that I can decide if I want to explore more.
-As a fan on social media, I want to follow Kanye on Instagram, X, and YouTube, so that I can keep up with new content and announcements.
-As a user, I want to sign up for updates with my name and email, so that I can get notified about future shows or news.
-As a mobile user, I want the site to still look clean and readable on a smaller screen, so that I can use it comfortably on my phone.

**Wireframes & Mockups**

Homepage & Social Section: designed to have a large hero GIF, Tour preview, social circles, and sign-up form.
Shows Page Wireframe: separate page matching the homepage style, with a vertical list of shows and “Tickets” buttons on the right (based on my Adobe XD wireframe).

**Testing**
**Manual Testing of Key User Stories**

1. Navigation

-Clicked YE WORLD logo → confirmed it always returns to index.html.
-Clicked Shows in the nav → confirmed it opens shows.html.
-Checked that navigation bar looks consistent on homepage and Shows page.

2. View All Dates Button

-On the homepage, clicked “VIEW ALL DATES” → confirmed it links to shows.html.
-Checked that the Shows page loads with the full tour list visible.

3. Tickets Buttons

-On the Shows page, clicked each “Tickets” button.
-Currently they may link to placeholder URLs or #; plan to replace with real ticket links later.
-Verified hover states and button styling remain consistent.

4. Social Media Circles

-Hovered over each circle → confirmed the hover zoom effect works.
-Clicked each circle → confirmed the browser attempts to open the respective social media URL (Instagram/X/YouTube placeholders or real links).

5. Sign-Up Form

-Tried submitting with empty fields (if validation added later, you’d describe behaviour here).
-Checked that input fields and button are visible, aligned, and readable on different screen widths.
-Confirmed the form styling matches the homepage style (correct background color, fonts, and button).

6. Cross-Browser / Screen Check

Tested on at least:

-Chrome (desktop)
-Firefox (desktop)
-Checked main sections (hero, tour, shows, socials, sign-up) at common resolutions:
-1920×1080
-1366×768
-Smaller browser window sizes
-Verified text is still readable and layout doesn’t break badly.

**Bugs / Issues Noted**

-On very small screens, some sections may require extra responsive tweaks (e.g. large hero GIF and tour table).
-The form currently does not send data anywhere (front-end only), which is expected for now.
-Tickets buttons still use placeholder links until a real backend or external URLs are provided.

**Credits**
**Content**

-Tour dates, locations and venues are fictional / placeholder for the purpose of this school project.
-Any text referencing Kanye West is written by me as part of the project brief.
**Media**

-Main hero GIF and images are from Kanye West’s Sunday Service / performance clips (source to be credited if you used a specific video or image set).
-Background texture image inspired by / taken from vintage paper textures (credit your source or royalty-free site if applicable).
-Custom “Graduation bear + social logo” icons were generated/edited based on my own concept using AI/illustration tools.

**Acknowledgements**
